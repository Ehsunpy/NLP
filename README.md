Text Summarization Without Machine Learning
This project demonstrates text summarization techniques using mathematical formulas and heuristic approaches, without relying on machine learning models. It includes two Jupyter Notebook files designed to educate and guide users through the process of summarizing text step by step.

Features
Summarizes text using mathematical and statistical methods.
Focuses on easy-to-understand algorithms for text summarization.
Provides educational explanations and examples for learning purposes.
Files in the Repository
file1.ipynb:
Contains the primary logic for text summarization using mathematical approaches.
Includes detailed comments and explanations for understanding the process.
file2.ipynb:
Contains examples and demonstrations to help users better understand the summarization process.
Technologies Used
Python
Jupyter Notebook
Libraries:
Numpy
Pandas
Matplotlib (if visualizations are included)
Any other library (e.g., Scikit-learn, NLTK, etc., if used).
